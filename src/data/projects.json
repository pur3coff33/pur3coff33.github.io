        "description": "At Theoria Medical, I worked as a Mid-level Application Developer primarily in Billings and Payments team where I improved the external data extraction pipeline by adding strict validation, retry logic, and better error handling—reducing invalid data by 99% and cutting manual review work by over 50%. I automated high-volume recurring tasks using Google Apps Script, Python, and mongosh, lowering operational workload by 95%. I also built and parsed HL7 message payloads for billing, insurance, and patient-information systems while adhering to HIPAA requirements, and collaborated with data engineers, QA testers, and data analyst teams to resolve data inconsistencies and enhance overall microservice reliability.",
